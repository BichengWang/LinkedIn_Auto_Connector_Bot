:star::star::star::star::star: ---> Star the Repo!



### ⚠️ Important Notes

This script is a LinkedIn bot that automatically sends connection requests with a custom note to profiles on LinkedIn. It uses the Selenium WebDriver to navigate LinkedIn and interact with the UI elements.

🚨🚨🚨 **Do not exceed 100 requests per week!**  🚨🚨🚨

LinkedIn may block your account if you exceed this limit.

P.S. For LinkedIn team - ooops, sorry! I was boring! 

### 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. **💼 Add My LinkedIn:**  
   You can connect with me on LinkedIn: [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrbondarenko/)

2. **🔍 Set Up Your Search Link:**  
   To set up your search link, follow these steps:
   - Go to [LinkedIn's main page](https://www.linkedin.com/).
   - In the search bar at the top, type in the keywords relevant to the people you want to connect with (e.g., "Tech Recruiter", "Cloud Engineer").
   - Press Enter to see the search results.
   - On the search results page, click on the "People" filter to narrow the results to LinkedIn profiles only.
   - Copy the URL from your browser's address bar. This URL is your `SEARCH_LINK`.
   - Open the bot script and find the `SEARCH_LINK` variable. Replace the existing link with the one you copied from LinkedIn.

3. **🎉 Have Fun!**  
   Start the bot and watch as it expands your network with targeted connection requests.
